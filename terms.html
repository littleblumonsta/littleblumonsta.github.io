                    <strong>8. Your Interactions with Other Users</strong>
                </p>
                <p>

                    You are solely responsible for your interactions with other players with whom you interact through any
                    Game. If you have a problem with another player, we are not required to get involved, but we can if we
                    desire. You will fully cooperate with us to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper
                    activity, including without limitation granting BluMonsta access to any portion of your account.
                </p>
                <p>

                    If you have a dispute with another player, you release BluMonsta (and our employees, officers,
                    directors, agents, affiliates and joint ventures) from responsibility, claims, demands, and/or damages
                    (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, resulting from that
                    dispute or connected to that dispute. This includes damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data.
                </p>
                <p>

                    If you are located in California, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “<strong>A general
                    release
                    does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor
                    at
                    the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his
                    settlement with the debtor.</strong>”
                </p>
                <p>

                    If you live outside of California, you waive any other statute, law, or rule of similar effect in your
                    jurisdiction.

                <p>

                    We respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do as well. We respond to notices
                    of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and
                    similar or equivalent other local laws that may apply. For more information, please go to BluMonsta’s
                    Copyright/DMCA Page on our Site to review our notification guidelines. We reserve the right to terminate
                    any player’s access to the Services if we determine that the player is a “repeat infringer.” We do not
                    have to notify the player before we do this.

                    <strong>10. Payment Terms</strong>
                </p>
                <p>

                    10.1 In-Game purchases.
                </p>
                <p>

                    BluMonsta may license to you certain virtual goods to be used within the Games and which you may
                    purchase with real money or which you may earn or redeem via gameplay (“Virtual Items”). When you obtain
                    such Virtual Items from BluMonsta or its authorized designee, you receive a limited, personal,
                    non-transferable, non-sublicensable and revocable license to use such Virtual Items within the
                    applicable Game and solely for non-commercial use.
                </p>
                <p>

                    When you purchase Virtual Items in our Games on third-party platforms such as Facebook, Apple or Google,
                    BluMonsta is not a party to the transaction and your purchase will be governed by the third-party
                    platform’s payment terms and conditions. Please review the platform’s terms of service for additional
                    information.
                </p>
                <p>

                    For Virtual Items, your order will represent an offer to us to obtain a limited license and right to use
                    the relevant Virtual Item(s) that will be accepted by us when we accept payment. At that point, the
                    limited license begins.
                </p>
                <p>

                    For orders to obtain a limited license and right to use Virtual Items, by clicking the purchase/order
                    button on the purchase window or page you:
                </p>
                <ol>

                    <li>agree that we will supply the Virtual Items to you as soon as we have accepted your order; and
                    </li>
                    <li>if you reside in the European Union (the “EU”), you acknowledge that you will therefore no longer
                        have the right to cancel under the EU’s Consumer Rights Directive (as implemented by the law of the
                        country where you are located) once we start to supply the Virtual Item.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>

                    You understand that while you may “earn,” “buy,” or “purchase” Virtual Items in our Services, you do not
                    legally “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance
                    of real currency or its equivalent. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account does not
                    constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of
                    the extent of your limited license.
                </p>
                <p>

                    ALL SALES ARE FINAL: YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BLUMONSTA IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON,
                    AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS
                    CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY, OR WHETHER YOU MADE A PAYMENT THROUGH OUR
                    SITE OR ANOTHER PLATFORM SUCH AS APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, OR ANY OTHER SITES OR PLATFORMS WHERE WE OFFER
                    OUR SERVICES.
                    PURCHASES TO ACQUIRE A LIMITED LICENSE AND RIGHT TO USE VIRTUAL ITEMS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE TO THE FULLEST
                    EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Additional Payment Terms:
                </p>
                <p>

                    You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an account registered to
                    you. BluMonsta may revise the pricing for the Virtual Items it licenses to you through the Services at
                    any time. BluMonsta may modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time, with or without notice. Virtual
                    Items cannot be sold, traded, transferred, or exchanged for cash.
                </p>
                <p>

                    10.2 Subscriptions
                </p>
                <p>

                    Some of BluMonsta’s Games may offer subscription-based Services. If you purchase a subscription, then by
                    clicking the purchase button you are requesting that we begin supplying the subscription Services
                    immediately and you are entering into a monthly subscription contract with BluMonsta. You are also
                    authorizing a charge to you on a recurring basis of a monthly subscription fee at the rate quoted at the
                    time of purchase. By purchasing a subscription, we will automatically charge on a recurring basis the
                    payment method associated with your account. For subscription Services purchased in a BluMonsta Game
                    played on a platform such as Apple or Google, the applicable platform will charge you for the
                    subscription fee and the platform’s payment terms will apply. Please review the appropriate platform’s
                    payment terms for additional information.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Trial subscriptions are offered free of charge for a certain period of time from activation specified in
                    the relevant trial offer in the Game. If you do not cancel the subscription within such trial period,
                    the trial subscription will automatically convert into a paid subscription for the fees and for the
                    subscription period set out in the Game at the time of the activation of the trial period. You may
                    cancel a subscription during its free trial period using the subscription setting of your account. Any
                    paid subscription you activate begins immediately from the activation of such paid subscription and not
                    after the expiration of any trial period. Any unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a
                    subscription is activated prior to the expiration of such trial period.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Your subscription will automatically renew each subscription period unless and until you terminate your
                    subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews, otherwise payment
                    of the subscription fees for the next period will be taken automatically via your chosen payment method.
                    You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing BluMonsta with valid credit
                    card or payment account details for payment of all fees. In case the subscription fee cannot be taken
                    from your account due to absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reason,
                    your subscription will be automatically cancelled.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Subscription rates are based on an amount in U.S. Dollars. If you are using a local currency, the actual
                    amount may fluctuate based on currency exchange rates without notice to you. The charges will be applied
                    to the payment instrument or method you provide when you start your subscription (or to a different
                    payment instrument or method, if you change your account information). Please note that prices and
                    charges are subject to change. If we make a change to the monthly subscription rate in U.S. Dollars, we
                    will notify you of such change in advance.
                </p>
                <p>

                    Once you have purchased a subscription, you cannot cancel your subscription for the current subscription
                    period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a subscription. However, you may cancel your
                    subscription for the next subscription period as follows: you can manage and cancel your subscription at
                    any time in your “Account Settings” of your device. For iOS subscriptions, please see Apple’s support
                    page <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039">https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202039</a>.
                    For Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play’s

                    Except where required by applicable law, paid subscription fees are non-refundable.
                    BluMonsta in its sole discretion and at any time may modify the subscription fee. Any subscription fee
                    change will become effective at the end of the then-current subscription period. You will be provided
                    reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fee. If you do not take action to agree to the
                    increase in subscription fee, your subscription shall expire at the end of the then-current subscription
                    period.

                    provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive will survive, including, without

                    warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of

                <p>

                    <u>Binding Arbitration</u>. This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States and
                    Canada.
                    If we cannot resolve our dispute informally via customer support, you and BluMonsta agree to the fullest
                    extent permitted by law to resolve any claim or dispute through final and binding arbitration. This
                    agreement to arbitrate applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits within the
                    exceptions described below. You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to
                    resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the terms or
                    formation of this agreement, including whether any dispute between us is subject to this agreement to
                    arbitrate and whether all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <u>Exceptions to Arbitration</u>. This Section 19 does not apply to the following types of claims or
                    disputes,
                    which you or we may bring in court in accordance with Section 20 below.
                </p>
                <p>

                    secrets, copyrights, or patents);<br>
                    (2) Relating to any violation of our Code of Conduct;<br>

                    <u>Class Action Waiver</u>. YOU AND BLUMONSTA AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WILL BE
                    CONDUCTED
                    ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THIS MEANS THAT, IN
                    CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE, YOU AND BLUMONSTA BOTH AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A
                    PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING. FURTHER, UNLESS YOU AND BLUMONSTA AGREE
                    OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR IN ANY DISPUTE MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS
                    AND MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS ACTION PROCEEDING.

                <p>
                    <u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</u>. The arbitration will be administered by the American
                    Arbitration
                    Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”)
                    except as modified by this Section 19. The AAA Rules are available at <a
                        href="https://www.adr.org/arbitration">https://www.adr.org/arbitration</a>.
                    The arbitrator will apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable
                    statutes of limitation. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms of Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Arbitration Process</u>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party
                    with a
                    written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules at <a
                        href="https://www.adr.org/arbitration">https://www.adr.org/arbitration</a>. The
                    arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected
                    by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree
                    upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will
                    appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>. Any arbitration under this section that is required to take
                    place in
                    person will take place pursuant to the Rules, which provide that face-to-face proceedings be conducted
                    at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to
                    travel and other pertinent circumstances. If your claim does not exceed US$10,000, then the arbitration
                    will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you
                    request a hearing and then the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds
                    US$10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the
                    arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties,
                    consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Arbitrator’s Decision</u>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the
                    AAA
                    Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the
                    arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
                    jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
                    claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual
                    claim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Fees</u>. Each party's responsibility to pay the arbitration filing, administrative and arbitrator
                    fees will
                    depend on the circumstances of the arbitration and are set forth in the AAA Rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>Changes</u>. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, if we make any future
                    change to
                    this Section 19, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the
                    change to <a href="mailto:legal@littleblumonsta.com">legal@littleblumonsta.com</a>

                <p>
                    <u>Survival</u>. This Section 19 shall survive termination of these Terms.

                </p>
                <p>

                    These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between us and you regarding
                    the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or
                    agreements between us and you regarding the Services. If for any reason a court of competent
                    jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
                    enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full
                    force and effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
                    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. We
                    may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms
                    will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms, including those regarding
                    modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For
                    notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such
                    right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
                    signed by our duly authorized representative. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise
                    by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
                    under these Terms or otherwise.
