                <p>
                    BluMonsta takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access
                    or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties. Although we make good faith
                    efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating environment
                    that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that
                    information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt
                    to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our
                    security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this
                    information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against,
                    loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or
                    method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.

                <p><strong>7. Data Retention</strong></p>
                <p>
                    BluMonsta retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide you Services,
                    unless we are required by law to delete or if BluMonsta accepts your request to delete
                    the information. We will also retain and use your personal data as necessary to comply with
                    our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                </p>
                <p><strong>8. Our Policy Regarding Children</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 or
                    knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 16, please do not send
                    any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email
                    address. No one under the age of 16 may provide any personal data. In the event that we learn
                    that we have collected personal data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information
                    as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child
                    under the age of 16, please contact us.
                </p>
                <p><strong>9. Transfer of Personal Data Outside Your Country</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other
                    third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or
                    jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not
                    have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and we take steps to ensure
                    adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of information to the U.S. and the use
                    and disclosure of information about you, including personal data, as described in this Policy.
                </p>
                <p><strong>10. Lawful Basis for Processing</strong></p>
                <p>
                    On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the
                    performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide the Services
                    to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning
                    our products and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also
                    process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention,
                    improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers;
                    where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no other lawful basis for such
                    processing, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you. You have the
                    right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.
                </p>
